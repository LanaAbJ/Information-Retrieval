Like Io, Europa orbits close to Jupiter and has sizable moons orbiting beyond it. And so, like Io, Europa gets squeezed by fluctuating gravitational pulls, warming up its interior.\n","The result of this squeezing, though, is totally different on the two moons because they’re made of different stuff. Unlike rocky Io, Europa has a surface made mostly of solid water ice. So when Europa gets squeezed by getting closer to and farther from Jupiter, the friction created inside the moon heats up the subsurface ice and turns it into liquid water.\n","\n","Doc 2:\n","Italian cuisine includes deeply rooted traditions common to the whole country, as well as all the regional gastronomies, different from each other, especially between the north, the centre and the south of Italy, which are in continuous exchange.Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated with variations throughout the country.\n"," Italian cuisine offers an abundance of taste, and is one of the most popular and copied around the world.One of the main characteristics of Italian cuisine is its simplicity, with many dishes made up of few ingredients, and therefore Italian cooks often rely on the quality of the ingredients, rather than the complexity of preparation.\n","\n","Doc 3:\n","Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen,followed by helium, which constitutes a quarter of its mass and a tenth of its volume. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet receives from the Sun.\n","\n","Doc 4:\n","Asteroids, sometimes called minor planets, are rocky.Most of this ancient space rubble can be found orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter within the main asteroid belt. The majority of asteroids originate from the main asteroid belt located between Mars and Jupiter, according to NASA.Asteroids are rocky and metallic objects that orbit the Sun but are too small to be considered planets. They are known as minor planets. Asteroids range in size from Ceres, which has a diameter of about one thousand km, down to the size of pebbles are contained within a main belt that exists between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have orbits that cross Earth's path and some have even hit the Earth in times past.\n","\n","Doc 5:\n","A star is an astronomical object comprising a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by self-gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night, but their immense distances from Earth make them appear as fixed points of light. The most prominent stars have been categorized into constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars have proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogs that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations, stars are responsible for the manufacture and distribution of heavy elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and their characteristics are intimately tied to the characteristics of the planetary systems that may coalesce about them.\n","\n","Doc 6:\n","A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying. Another kind of black hole is called \"stellar.\" Its mass can be up to twenty times more than the mass of the sun. There may be many, many stellar mass black holes in Earth's galaxy. Earth's galaxy is called the Milky Way.\n","The largest black holes are called supermassive. \n","\n","Doc 7:\n","Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy, Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity – the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.Our solar system is a region of space. It has no atmosphere. But it contains many worlds – including Earth – with many kinds of atmospheres.\n","\n","Doc 8:\n","Meteoroids are what we call “space rocks” that range in size from dust grains to small asteroids. This term only applies when they’re in space.Most are pieces of other, larger bodies that have been broken or blasted off. Some come from comets, others from asteroids, and some even come from the Moon and other planets. Some meteoroids are rocky, while others are metallic, or combinations of rock and metal.\n","\n","Doc 9:\n","Uranus is The seventh planet from the Sun with the third largest diameter in our solar system, Uranus is very cold and windy. The ice giant is surrounded by thirteen faint rings and twenty-seven small moons as it rotates at a nearly ninety-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin sideways, orbiting the Sun like a rolling ball. All of Uranus' inner moons appear to be roughly half water ice and half rock. The composition of the outer moons remains unknown, but they are likely captured asteroids.Although Uranus is visible to the naked eye, it was long mistaken as a star because of the planet's dimness and slow orbit.\n","\n","Doc 10:\n","Earth is the fifth-largest planet in the solar system. It's smaller than the four gas giants Jupiter,Saturn, Uranus and Neptune,but larger than the three other rocky planets, Mercury, Marsand Venus.While Earth orbits the sun, the planet is simultaneously spinning around an imaginary line called an axis that runs through the core, from the North Pole to the South Pole.Earth is the only planet that has a single moon. Earth sometimes temporarily hosts orbiting asteroids or large rocks.They are typically trapped by Earth's gravity for a few months or years before returning to an orbit around the Sun\n","\n","Doc 11:\n","Saudi Arabia food culture has developed largely from surrounding regions, so visitors to the Kingdom have a pleasant variety of both local dishes and international cuisine to explore.Many traditional dishes enjoyed in Saudi Arabia are much like the Middle Eastern cuisine found in the surrounding countries of Yemen, Egypt, Oman and the UAE. In fact, most of these countries have been “swapping” recipes and flavors for centuries, so it’s sometimes difficult to pinpoint where a dish originated. Saudi Arabia food culture follows this culinary code for the most part, but the country does lay an indisputable claim to one dish, and that’s kabsa.\n","\n","Doc 12:\n","The Milky Way is a huge collection of stars, dust and gas. It’s called a spiral galaxy because if you could view it from the top or bottom, it would look like a spinning pinwheel. The Sun is located on one of the spiral arms, about Twenty Five Thousand Light-years away from the center of the galaxy.The major arms consist of the highest densities of both young and old stars; the minor arms are primarily filled with gas and pockets of star-forming activity.\n","\n","#########Corpus after Pre-Processing#########\n","Doc 1:\n","anoth jupit larg moon europa like io europa orbit

Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.Our solar system is a region of space. It has no atmosphere.
