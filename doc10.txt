The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System and is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. The Sun's core is extremely hot and dense, where nuclear fusion occurs, producing energy that radiates outward and supports the Sun's structure. This energy takes around 8 minutes to reach Earth from the Sun
