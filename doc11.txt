Comets are icy bodies that originate in the outer regions of the Solar System. When they pass close to the Sun, they heat up and release gases, forming a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes a tail. These tails always point away from the Sun due to the solar wind. Comets are made up of ice, dust, and organic compounds, and they are considered remnants of the early Solar System.
